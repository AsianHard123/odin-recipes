For this project we used HTML to create recipes. For this project the skills I was able to demostrate is to be able to be able to include images, and also be able to be able to portray the uses for orderd and unorderd list. I was also able to use some HTML to alter the size of the butter chicken image as I found out that it was wayy to big. I Created a images dir so that it is easier for me to acces what I want as it will allow my directory to be alot more organised as each pic/document was in the dir that represented it. I was also able to link my recipe html files so that I am able to click on a link with the recipe name and be led to the desired recipe that i clicked on while also opening on a new tab, and making sure that the user is not able to be tabnabb.
